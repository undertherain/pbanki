# Introduction #

## What is Mindcraft ##

Mindcraft is a spaced repetition software designed to run flawlessly on low-memory mobile devices. Unlike [Anki](http://anki.ichi2.net), [Mnemosyne](http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/) or [SuperMemo](http://www.supermemo.com/), it is not a fully functional program that supports creating and editing user decks. Also unlike Mnemosyne or Anki, it is written in C++ and not in an interpreted language like Python. This makes Mindcraft a very light and fast application for actual study-on-the-go, even if the user decks are very big. It supports such popular formats as .anki or .mem (Anki and Mnemosyne decks) and requires no file conversion for them.

## What is Spaced Repetition ##

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material; this exploits the psychological spacing effect. You can read a more detailed article on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition
