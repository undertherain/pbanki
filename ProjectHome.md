Mindcraft is a spaced repetition software designed to run flawlessly on low-memory mobile devices. Unlike [Anki](http://anki.ichi2.net), [Mnemosyne](http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/) or [SuperMemo](http://www.supermemo.com/), it is not a fully functional program that supports creating and editing user decks. Also unlike Mnemosyne or Anki, it is written in C++ and not in an interpreted language like Python. This makes Mindcraft a very light and fast application for actual study-on-the-go, even if the user decks are very big.

This software was developed for PocketBook 360 and compatible devices and will not work on newer readers, sorry.

Mindcraft project was started to provide a viewer for Anki decks for PocketBook devices and was initially called PBAnki. Later on it was renamed to reflect the change in the project goals that currently include Mnemosyne format as well as Anki's. Mindcraft will read both .anki and .mem files natively, with no conversion needed.
