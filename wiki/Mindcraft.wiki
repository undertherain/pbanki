== What is PBAnki ==

PBAnki is a spaced repetition software designed to run on various kinds of mobile devices. Unlike [http://anki.ichi2.net Anki], [http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/ Mnemosyne] or SuperMemo, it is not a fully functional program that supports creating and editing user decks. Instead of all these features PBAnki makes a very light and fast application for actual study-on-the-go, even if the user decks are very big. The goal of the project is to create a viewer that would run flawlessly on low-memory mobile devices. It supports such popular formats as .anki or .mem (Anki and Mnemosyne decks) and requires no conversion of user files.
